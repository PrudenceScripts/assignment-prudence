# Coin Flip and Matrix Multiplication in Python

This project demonstrates two basic programming concepts using Python:

1. **Coin Flip Simulation** – to illustrate probability.
2. **Matrix Multiplication** – to practice linear algebra and nested loops.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then run the file from your terminal:

```bash
python coinflip.py
python matrixmultiplication.py
